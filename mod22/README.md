# Stream and Optional

## Stream
The designers of the **Java** API interface have incorporated into the update a new abstraction called [Stream](https://github.com/maxfideles/ebac-backend-java-specialist-max/tree/main/mod22/EgStreams), which allows you to process data in a declarative way. Even more, **streams allow you to take advantage of multi-core architectures without having to program lines of multiprocess code**.

A flow is a sequence of objects that supports several methods that can be channeled to produce the desired result. The method provided by the stream is broadly categorized as:

- [Intermediate Operations](https://github.com/maxfideles/ebac-backend-java-specialist-max/tree/main/mod22/EgStreams2) 
- [Terminal Operations](https://github.com/maxfideles/ebac-backend-java-specialist-max/tree/main/mod22/EgStreams3)
