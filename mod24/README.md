# MOCK 

Mock are fake objects that simulates real objects.


It's needed to do unit tests in isolated componets, and in some cases there are dependency among classes. For example a service that depends of a repository to access that data in a database. In this case is needed to test the service and the repository isolated, without one depending of each other.


On these situation Mock objects are used.
