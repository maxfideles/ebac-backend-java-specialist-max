# Ordering a list of numbers 

#### Getting the numbers 
It's created two arrays and a string variable, then follow the next:

- It's asked for the user a list of numbers separated by comma, and it will be saved into the string variable;
- Using the method split on the string variable, it's saved each number in a different position into one of the arrays;

#### Converting 
As the array with the numbers is an array of string elements, it's needed to convert its elements to compare them later on.
Due to it was necessary to create a function to do it.

-  Use the function to convert the elements of an array from string to int type.

#### Comparing

As it's needed to go through all the array, now with numbers of int type, to compare each elements was used two *for*, one inside the other.
- One *for* to go through each position on the array;
- The other *for* to compare the element on the current position to the next one.
