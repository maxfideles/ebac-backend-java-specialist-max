## Using Abstract Class

An Abstract Class is a model for other classes. It can't be instanced and may contain
abstract methods that can be implemented on the descendant classes.

In java it does the process of hiding the intricate code 
implementation details from the user and just provides the user 
with the necessary information. This phenomenon is called Data 
Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming [[1](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/java-tutorial/abstract-class-in-java#:~:text=Abstract%20Class%20in%20Java%20does,%2DOriented%20Programming%20(Java).)]

To use the abstract class to creat other class, it's used the 
concept **heritage** from the Object-Oriented Programming.
