An Abstract Class is a model for other classes. It can't be instanced and may contain
abstract methods that can be implemented on the descendant classes.

In java it does the process of hiding the intricate code 
implementation details from the user and just provides the user 
with the necessary information. This phenomenon is called Data 
Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming. Generally, an abstract
class in Java is **a template that stores the data members and 
methods** that we use in a program. Abstraction in Java keeps the 
user from viewing complex code implementations and provides 
the user with necessary information. [[1](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/java-tutorial/abstract-class-in-java#:~:text=Abstract%20Class%20in%20Java%20does,%2DOriented%20Programming%20(Java).)]

To use the abstract class to create another class is used 
**heritage** from the concept of Object-Oriented Programming.
